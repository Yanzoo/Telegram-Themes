# Telegram-Themes
These are my themes for telegram, simply export them and share the files to yourself on the app, there you'll be able to install the theme you desire.

# List of Themes
### Beach Fall
A calm coastal style theme, with the color of the dawn.
### Flat B&W
Based on the work of hundred rabbits, and partially based on Rotonde(https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Rotonde), the name says it all, a very simple black and white theme.
